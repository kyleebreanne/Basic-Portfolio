            Welcome! Thanks for visiting I'm Kylee and I hope you enjoy it here.
            A few things about me,I was born and raised in Arizona. After High School
            I decided I has done with the desert and moved to Mississippi to go to College.
            After a year I decided that I pefer the "dry heat" over the humidity, I fell in love
            with the south but I missed my family and friends.
        </p>

            I have worked in the health field for 5+ years. In that time I
            was able to work at a hospital, Laboratory, Surgery Center, Pain Clinic's and
            Rehabilition Centers. I was able to set up and implement new systems in clinics.
            I was part of the three Laboratory start ups in Arizona and California. And the last
            and most recent venture is Telemedicine where I see patients remotely and asses
            their condition and risk.
